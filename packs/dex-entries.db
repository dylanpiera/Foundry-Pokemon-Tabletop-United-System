Unfortunately, they are still very clumsy terrestrially, as their numerous feathers and heavy, wing-like arms make it difficult for them to stay balanced.

Because of their clumsiness, though, any prey that do manage to outsmart them are almost guaranteed to escape. This likely was downfall of these Pokémon; though smart and cooperative, their ungainly movements made it difficult for them compete as faster, more agile predators evolved. A recent excavation revealed a&nbsp; Helix-like fossil with Archeops bite marks on it, suggesting that not only did Archeops likely hunt relatives of Omanyte while extant, but also that these Pokémon frequented coastal environments to find food as well.

Berries and other plant life are very scarce at such altitudes, so Crabominable instead feed on low-growing moss and lichens. They use their powerful claws to smash through layers of hard permafrost and access the soil beneath. Though predators are scarce where they dwell, Crabominable can lop off and fire their claws like rockets to defend themselves. The claws will grow back in just about a week’s time. Their claws also stay quite cold even outside of their snowy environments, allowing them to deliver icy blows wherever they are. Crabominable seem to oddly throw punches about as they travel, punching what seems to be nothing almost constantly. It is said many unexplained noises heard by mountain hikers can be attributed to Crabominable punching blindly in blizzards.

Still, cooperation is imperative for both attacking and defending, and bickering Binacle are unlikely to survive for long. These creatures attach themselves to rocks by excreting a special cement that glues them to stones; even the strongest forces cannot pull them off once attached. When threatened, Binacle contract themselves and hide the vulnerable portions of their bodies, exposing only their bare heads and sharp claws. Binacle are capable of removing themselves from rocks by excreting an enzyme that dissolves the cement holding them, allowing them to inch away to find other stones; they are known to do this when bickering with their partners (though extracting themselves does leave them completely exposed until they can find new rocks).

They will similarly drop rocks onto hard nuts Berries to crack them open, or set simple vine traps across treetops you ensnare other bird Pokémon intruding into their territory. Corvisquire are known to have long memories, said to be comparable to Pokémon like Copperajah.

Lone Politoed are often the heads of local communities of Poliwag and Poliwhirl, commanding them sternly with their croaks. The curls on their heads are symbols of dominance. When their positions are challenged by intruding or recently-evolved Politoed, the ones with larger curls ultimately become the leaders. Politoed with short curls or curls lost&nbsp;in battle have been observed to command little to no respect from their peers; their bellows will simply be ignored. Politoed are equally adept in the water as they are on land. Because of their porous skin, they must return into the water at least once every 24 hours in order to rehydrate themselves. When choruses of least four Politoed are observed singing together, it is said that rainstorms are imminent.

According to Aether Foundation research, Xurkitree possess electrogenetic organs within their bodies that generate electricity, allowing them to let loose up to 1,000,000 volts at once; this number is actually an estimate, as the subject Xurkitree in fact caused the voltmeter to explode during testing. Inferring from the activity of the Electric-type Pokémon of our world, researchers believe that Xurkitree likely dwells in electricity-rich areas on their home world. Alolan mythology often depicts Xurkitree with their “tails” embedded into the ground. Researchers believe that they are able to draw electricity from the ground in this manner. Indeed, onlookers reported seeing these creatures do just this before letting loose shocks.

Male Unfezant will also swing their heads wildly in&nbsp;order to both threaten opponents and attract mates, as the action makes their tassels appear longer. These adornments are cumbersome for flight, so females tend to be better long-distance fliers than males. Stronger wings allow males to fly faster over short distances, however. Both genders are equally adept at running, perhaps even more so than flying. Like Pidove and Tranquill, Unfezant are fiercely loyal to their trainers, refusing to become close with anyone (including potential mates, unless explicitly given permission) other than them.

The orange crystals jutting from their bodies are in fact hardened growths of their cores, which sometimes leak from cracks in their forms when they store too much energy. These outgrowths are signs of healthy Boldore, as they signal a surplus of energy. A single crystal holds enough energy to fuel 100 trucks; for this reason, they are quite valuable in the energy industry. These orange growths are also harder than diamond. Boldore cannot turn, so they scuttle back and forth or left and right. They use their ears to detect echoes and vibrations around them. Unlike Roggenrola, Boldore use their ears to find rather than avoid water; since their radioactive cores are now much stronger, they are also more prone to overheating. For this reason, Boldore must occasionally drink water cool themselves down to prevent potential meltdowns, though they still dislike getting their exteriors wet. Though Boldore are not yet specifically protected by any official legislation, increased pressure on Boldore populations due to their energy-rich crystals has led to many conservation efforts arising in multiple regions.

This is why they often cluster on top of their parents, as the bodies of Avalugg radiate freezing air that keep their children comfortable. To defend themselves, Bergmite expel chilling air of temperatures as low as -150ºF (-100ºC) to freeze foes solid. They cover their bodies with sharp spikes of ice by freezing moisture in the air to shield themselves from attacks. Bergmite never allow their true bodies to show through the ice covering them.

Drifblim float in large groups across clear skies; during the daytime, they are often drowsy and lethargic, aloof to the weather and environment around them. They become more active at dusk, however. Mysteriously, entire groups of Drifblim seem to simply disappear when observed; no one knows where they go or how they vanish so suddenly, though according to folklore they are in fact traveling across the boundary to the spirit realm.

Eiscue catch prey by dangling their singular hairs into the water like lures to attract fish. In fact, the hairs are directly connected to their brains by a single nerve, making them quite sensitive. These hairs also radiate cold to freeze the immediate surrounding water; they are said to radiate even colder air when Eiscue have ideas. This is how Eiscue reform their ice blocks when they are shattered by attackers. The real heads of Eiscue are quite heat-sensitive, so the ice blocks help them keep cool in more temperate regions. Though Eiscue dislike being bare-headed, the worried expression of Noice Face Eiscue (as such individuals are called) is a popular emoticon in modern media.

Their milk has a naturally rich and sweet taste, richer and sweeter when sourced from Miltank raised in rich pastures, and is often made into yogurt for those who cannot consume it naturally. It should be noted that consuming too much Miltank milk in a short period of time can result in an upset stomach. Curiously, when around young kids or Pokémon, Miltank will produce more milk than usual. Farmers use this to their advantage, opening up their farms as petting zoos and encouraging parents to take their kids to visit. Their sturdy bodies make them well-suited for children. Milking a Miltank oddly benefits from a musical background; one must pull on its udders rhythmically to extract milk efficiently.

Mr. Rime wave their icy canes in time with their steps, and their audiences feel compelled to clap along to the beat as well. The patterns on their bellies exude psychic energy that smoothens their movements and lightens their footsteps; they in fact also act second sets of eyes to help Mr. Rime stay alert to how the audience is feeling. Mr. Rime can wave their canes to freeze moisture in the air around them, creating sparkling flurries that enrapture onlookers. The horns on their heads act like feelers that sense the audience's anticipation, letting Mr. Rime know how to best thrill them with their next moves.","owned":false},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"IGEsv6ftVd7aL1D2"}

They will dig into cave walls in search of jewels (and Carbink), hoarding them in large piles in their nests. Gabite nests are constantly targeted by thieves due to the immense value of the jewels they hold. However, their hostility make infiltrating their nests a very difficult task. They will remain motionless for hours at a time keeping an eye on their hoards. Research shows that only Sableye, thanks to their stealthiness, can successfully and consistently sneak in and out of Gabite nests to snatch and eat gems; the victimized Gabite will give ferocious and relentless chase to them if spotted, however. Gabite scales are thought to have medicinal properties. Some people believe that grinding the scales and then consuming the resulting powder will cure any illness. Though illegal to sell, the difficulty of obtaining these scales make them very valuable on the black market in many regions. Gabite shed their scales along with their skins periodically as they grow, but these shed scales are regarded as lower quality in traditional medicine than \"fresh\" ones."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"IKoMKXaV9aDadmZM"}

When Baltoy find other Baltoy, they will congregate together and begin crying in unison, drawing more Baltoy to the area. Why they do so is unknown, but some speculate it may have to do with some sort of ancient human ritual ingrained in&nbsp;their memories. They seem to have a particular affinity for congregating around buried tombs and graveyards. Baltoy have spectacular senses of balance, capable of spinning on their feet even while sleeping. At times, Baltoy may be found spinning on their heads instead of their feet. Why they do so is unknown, as spinning in this manner does not improve their locomotion.

They use their bright red shovels to lure in small children; those who grab their shovels fall under their influences and are compelled to begin adding more sand to their bodies, making them larger. If a Sandygast loses its shovel, it may instead temporarily use a tree branch, flag, or other sturdy object it finds on the shore until it can find its shovel again. They are very protective of these tools and will try their best to fight to regain them if stolen. Sandygast can suck the life force of living beings with their gaping mouths. In Alola, it is a test of courage to stick one’s hand in a Sandygast’s orifice. Obviously, beach-going parents warn their children to not play with wild Sandygast or grab their red shovels.

Budew rely primarily on their toxic pollen to discourage predators; they can also use Worry Seed to induce anxiety in foes via hallucinogenic plant seeds. Access to cleaner water seems to be correlated with more toxic pollen. Though they have historically been used as indicators of spring, recent studies have shown that Budew have begun opening their buds earlier and earlier in the season for the past few decades. Scientists believe that this trend is due to rising global temperatures, as Budew appear to open their buds in response to the climate rather than the time of year.

Bonsly are often found “crying;” in fact, they are not upset, but rather regulating their moisture levels by excreting excess fluids out of their eyes.

The more humid their surroundings, the more they will weep. In battle, this skill also goads enemies into letting their guards down. Bonsly are relatively skilled at mimicking trees, capable of remaining still for long periods of time. They dig small holes in the ground and bury themselves halfway, posing as small saplings.

To compound this problem, though they can be very plentiful in many areas where other Pokémon cannot be found, they also have the tendency to cluster in large numbers in very specific locations; despite being weak and defenseless, congregating en masse reduces the chance of each individual of being preyed upon—strength in numbers, essentially.

Kyurem is thought to be the empty husk left behind, longing to be whole again. It froze itself in ice in order to keep its feeble body from decaying. In Lacunosa Town, Unova, Kyurem is said to have arrived upon an icy meteor that landed near the town, creating the Giant Chasm. Residents believe that it roams around at night to eat locals, so they have built walls around the town and stay indoors after dark. Aside from this local myth, most believe that Kyurem indeed is the “original dragon” of legend. It can generate freezing air and energy, but it is said that the leaking of this energy caused it to freeze itself. No one has seen Kyurem’s whole form, though the group Team Plasma is said to have successfully fused either Reshiram or Zekrom with it.

Corsola can only survive in pristine, warm waters. They migrate south as temperatures cools through the year. Corsola use their horns to filter water and obtain nutrients; in polluted or cold seas, their horns lose their color, become brittle, and disintegrate. Corsola live in colonies, shedding their horns to create natural reefs. Other Pokémon often make their homes in these reefs. Notably, Pacifidlog Town, Hoenn, is a village in the middle of the ocean built entirely on a Corsola colony. Corsola populations can be used as a water quality detector. If they begin to appear sickly, it is a sign that the water is dirty. Corsola also shed their horns as distractions against predators like Mareanie.

Then, they work together to corner their prey; they have demonstrated to be intelligent enough to form complex, unique strategies for catching prey depending on their surroundings and the skills of their quarry. Houndour demonstrate some of the most efficient teamwork in the Pokémon world. Around dawn,&nbsp;packs will howl ominously at the moon to&nbsp;indicate to other nearby packs of the boundaries of their territories. Unlike most pack hunters, Houndour packs have no true leaders. Rather, they all are equals and split responsibilities fairly; thus, there is never any infighting for dominance. Houndour are very affectionate towards those they care about; generally, this means other pack members, but for domestic ones this can mean trainers as well."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"MBQUTtrIs3QKW672"}

If their pastries smell good enough to attract Milcery, after all, then they are surely good enough for customers. As Milcery move, they agitate their bodies and incorporate surrounding air. Eventually, when they have gained enough volume in this manner, they will evolve. Milcery cream becomes infused with what the Pokémon have recently eaten or been around. When their aroma begins fragrant enough for trainers to smell it from afar, Milcery are approaching evolution."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"Th3BNNW0Inn5b5a9"}

Spinarak weave intricate webs of silk and then wait for prey to come by. They are very patient and can wait motionless for days or weeks for prey to arrive. When victims get tangled in their webs, they can detect the movements and even tell what was captured by the vibrations they create. Spinarak always wait for night to fall before investigating their catches. They subdue their prey, if still struggling, with venom, and then feast on their meals. Though their venom is not particularly strong, it is more than enough to incapacitate smaller prey. They can survive for weeks at a time on a good meal. The designs on their backs shift based on their moods. Spinarak and Ariados are often maligned in popular culture, portrayed as villains and aggressive hunters. In reality, Spinarak are actually playful Pokémon who only bite when threatened, and Ariados, while territorial, will also not attack unless provoked.

Their drilling is very noisy; they use different rhythms of pecking in order to communicate with one another.

In fact, Pikipek communication is one of the most well-studied in the field. Pikipek also have a fondness of shiny objects, storing them in tree holes. This is the root of the Alolan saying, “Something lost, something missed, check inside the Pikipek nest.” Pikipek can also shoot seeds with great force from their beaks.

They cover themselves with a slimy film to stay moist outside of the water. This film is poisonous; Wooper will often&nbsp;leave trails of this slime walking around on land. While contact this film can cause searing pain, it is not fatal. The growths on the sides of their heads are in fact gills; individuals with larger gills are considered more attractive to mates. When resting, Wooper will bury themselves in the sand to hide from predators. Some populations have been observed to cease development in this form, never evolving into Quagsire during their lifespans."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"VCoG94mJuYocE0Qy"}

It is theorized that pink West Sea Shellos are associated with warmer waters, and blue East Sea Shellos are associated with cooler waters. Though the two variants can still currently breed as one species, scientists believe that this may not be case in the future, when the two forms may not even recognize each other as related. Shellos can extend their necks very far to reach algae and plankton in difficult places. When squeezed, they will ooze a slippery purple fluid analogous to mammalian sweat. This substance makes it difficult for predators to grasp them so they can flee. They can similarly exude a sticky, but harmless purple goo to slow attackers. Shellos also have remarkable regenerative qualities, and researchers are currently studying their cellular properties in order to discover the biological mechanism behind this."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"ZTCYp4cjwPBprysG"}

The crystals on these Pokémon chill the surrounding air to temperatures as low as -240°F (-150°C), allowing them to instantly freezing moisture in the air. Aurorus use this ability to form blocks of ice in front of them and block incoming attacks; when threatened, they may also try to encase their foes in ice. These Pokémon can also create aurora-like lights by diffracting light through tiny ice crystals in the air. Because Aurorus relied primarily on the bitter cold to keep predators away from them, they likely went extinct during an ancient warming period in which much of the world’s ice melted. Such an event allowed many predators, who saw the large, yet slow and relatively defensive Aurorus as easy prey, to venture further north into once-icy regions. Scientists have recently discovered a fully-intact Aurorus frozen in a northern glacier; it is believed that the Aurorus froze itself to protect itself from some sort of danger, though the nature of this threat is unknown."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"b6iQ01O6HHrwnT4r"}

Once a Lileep roots itself on a rock, it will remain there for the rest of its life, regardless of how strong the waves or currents get.

The stronger their foes are, the stronger these flames burn, and the more determined Blaziken are to defeat them. Their ankles can also similarly ignite, enabling them to land fiery kicks as well as punches if necessary. Every few years, their feathers burn off from repeated exposure to fire. However, newer, softer ones regrow in their place.

Though&nbsp;unintentionally dangerous, Ferroseed are acutally rather docile Pokémon. They won’t attack unless attacked first, and even when faced an aggressor, the most a Ferroseed will do is release a burst of spikes being rolling away to safety. Their aim is quite poor without practice, however. Though their spikes make them very poor movers, Ferroseed can actually spin in place quickly by balancing themselves on the point of a single spike like a top. They have been known to lodge themselves into rocks in this manner. Recently, scientists have discovered that Ferrossed not only absorb minerals from stone through their spikes, but also vital nutrients from the moss that covers cave walls and ceilings."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"hOUaeIvEsf5PIIgn"}

They will still gladly consume these spoiled items, however, as they can eat just about anything without experiencing any ill effects thanks to their robust stomachs. In fact, a Munchlax sharing its possibly-rotten stored food with someone is a sure sign of trust. Despite how much they eat, Munchlax rarely are ever full; they constantly are&nbsp;looking for more to eat. Occasionally, they can be found wandering around houses; they will squeeze their way through small openings or windows to eat food left out for pets.

Brasses lead Falinks in all aspects of life, ordering them through numerous precise formations suited for different tasks. Falinks will adapt different formations for hunting, defending, scouting, and even resting. The units in each position will hold their shields in different orientations in order to maximize the area protection. Though Falinks are nigh-impenetrable when in defensive formations, they are at their weakest when changing places; for this reason, Falinks practice changing formations on a daily basis in order to ensure their transitions are as swift as possible.

Remoraid hunt by hiding just beneath the river’s surface and shooting out bullets of water at unsuspecting insects above. They can shoot up to 300 feet (91 m) away with amazing accuracy, even at moving targets. To do this, Remoraid squeeze their abdominal muscles to expel small pellets of water from their mouth. They also use this trick to escape from foes, propelling themselves backwards with the recoil. These “shots” even work underwater, striking foes from crevices on the riverbed or sea floor. As evolution approaches, Remoraid will swim downstream in large numbers back into the ocean, where they will stay for the rest of their lives. In Alola, the Remoraid population is fact entirely maritime, breeding and developing solely in the ocean; there, they are known as the \"snipers of the sea.\""},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"nKvDxfqFzjY1ivba"}

For this reason, some also call it the lunar emissary (as opposed to Solgaleo’s designation as the solar emissary).

They can survive with only one head, however. It was once believed that Vanilluxe formed when two Vanllish, partially melted from the day's heat, stuck together and refroze together during the night. Vanilluxe drinks large quantities of glacial water to store within&nbsp; their bodies. When both heads feel threatened , Vanilluxe will freeze and violently release their stored water as snow clouds or blizzards. This attack is indiscriminate and can freeze both friend and foe. The pipe-like structures growing out of their left heads constantly emit icy mist that shrouds them, keeping the ambient air sufficiently cold to prevent their slush from melting and concealing them from attackers.

Even Alolan elders wonder, however, why it would have remained in this dimension if this was the case, or why the island guardians have not dealt with it. Since no concrete evidence is present, the International Police does not consider Necrozma an Ultra Beast (though it is likely they keep an eye on it nonetheless). Necrozma is said to be darker than night itself. Its prism-like body is thought to refract light that enters it, allowing Necrozma to focus it into attacks. This creature is said to be extraordinarily vicious, firing lasers of concentrated light at anyone who dares disturb it as it voraciously searches for light to absorb. If it fails to consume enough, impurities build up in its body and turn it pitch-black, rendering it inert.  According to legend, Necrozma once attempted to consume the sun and the moon--possibly referring to Solgaleo and Lunala--in order to return to its original form, a radiant entity known as Ultra Necrozma. It hungered for both and desired to first hunt down one in order to harness its light and power to capture the other. Also called \"The Blinding One\" in the legend, Necrozma left the planet dark after absorbing all of its light before its inhabitants trapped it to prevent it from wreaking havoc elsewhere.

Drowzee (save for trained ones) rarely live near people, however, preferring to feed on the dreams of Pokémon in the grasslands that they call home. They get sick from bad dreams (which are said to taste sour), so they uses their noses to differentiate between good dreams and nightmares. Trained Drowzee can show people their dreams upon awakening.&nbsp;"},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"sJI2qU4Kl2FdXyGv"}

They can live for centuries, dedicating their lives solely to single gardens. Florges spend much of their time tending to their beautiful flowerbeds. Like their pre-evolutions, these Pokémon draw power from blooms and can become very formidable in large, ornate gardens. Florges are so skilled in horticulture that many people request their help in designing gardens. Historical kings and governors have invited Florges to design intricate flowerbeds for their castles. In recent times, toxic industrial runoff from factories have become a problem for Florges populations, with the toxins leaching into nearby soils and preventing the flowers that these Pokémon and their pre-evolutions need for sustenance from growing.

These Pokémon are said to have the hearts of warriors, as they will never turn their backs to foes and always remain humble about their fighting prowess. Jangmo-o use their hard scales to defend themselves from blows as well as attack enemies. Their scales make harsh, metallic clanging noises as they hit one another. Jangmo-o clang their scales to express emotions both in battle as well as in communication, making their habitats very noisy. Young Jangmo-o will clang scales together to build camaraderie&nbsp;and strength. Travelers will almost inevitably hear Jangmo-o in the wild before actually spotting them. Ancient tribes used to collect Jangmo-o scales and fashion war instruments out of them. They believed that ringing these instruments prior to battle would ensure their warriors fought bravely and valiantly. Anthropological excavations suggest that Jangmo-o were popular partners for military combatants in ancient Alolan society. Recently, scientists have found evidence that Jangmo-o scales are not, in fact, modified reptilian scales, but actually hardened fur; the implications of this finding have yet to be explored."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"ue0mU9zyHR82EWDB"}

By expelling all of this sand at once, Sandaconda can whip up huge sandstorms. They use this technique both to hunt&nbsp; as well as escape from confused predators. Sandaconda are not venomous and instead prefer to construct prey until they suffocate with their powerful bodies. Though a bit arrogant when full of sand, tese Pokémon become quite restless when low on it, as they are nearly defenseless when their neck sacs are empty. Sandaconda mix sharp gravel with their sand to so that they can cut enemies even upon contact with it. Small stones that Sandaconda swallow while burrowing through dunes can become lodged in their nostrils, however, preventing them from spitting sand properly. Wild Sandaconda sometimes develop mutualistic relationships with Dwebble to take care of this; the Dwebble will dislodge the stones from their nostrils while searching for new shells, while the Sandaconda will refrain from eating their arthropod allies."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"uf10Ta0CIEUWDaSv"}

This is because the oil coating the fur makes it unsuitable for clothing and most other uses. Additionally, the rarity of Cinccino make them poor choices for economic profit.

They use their flippers to break apart chunks of ice that get in their way. Their noses are highly sensitive, both to scents and to textures. When these Pokémon comes across unfamiliar objects, their first instinct is to balance and spin them on their noses. As they do so, they carefully examine their smells and textures to decide whether or not they like them. Sealeo are especially fond of round objects; they often play with Poké Balls, for example. Rather humorously, Sealeo can often be found balancing their rounder, younger relatives Spheal on their noses; most Spheal seem unshaken by this behavior, however, and often even enjoy the horseplay. Sealeo can learn new tricks very easily, particularly those involving the use of their noses.

They will not hesitate to locate the source of a foreign sound and attack it with their horns, especially if the threat appears to be endangering their young."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"zdZ2AVl49zbUfn49"}
{"name":"machamp","permission":{"default":0,"ADtNtonEM4LarFaX":3},"type":"dexentry","data":{"name":"","id":"68","entry":"Machamp are tremendously powerful Pokémon, capable of move mountains with just a single hand. They use a variety of fighting techniques to pummel their opponents, most of which involve all four of their limbs. For example, they may use three of their arms to hold down foes while using the fourth to deliver a punch strong enough to knock them over the horizon (or derail a train, as one infamous incident had proven; luckily, no one was hurt in the accident). Alternatively, they may instead execute a different move with each of their limbs--for example, an uppercut, a hook,&nbsp;a straight, and a karate chop all simultaneously with their four limbs. They can deliver swift, endless volleys of punches to relentlessly pummel down opponents. There is even a special name for a complex grab these Pokémon perform using all four of their arms: \"the Machamp special\". Machamp love challenges, and will only fight harder when faced against strong opponents. However, they are terrible at delicate, precise work; their arms get jumbled together when attempting to manage fine details, and they will often end up destroying whatever they were trying to work with in the first place."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"znt2jVTP5p548Xq2"}
{"name":"dustox","permission":{"default":0,"ADtNtonEM4LarFaX":3},"type":"dexentry","data":{"name":"","id":"269","entry":"Dustox are nocturnal Pokémon, feeding on the leaves of trees after the sun sets. They use their antennae like radars to navigate without light, though their eyes are in fact quite adept at seeing in the dark. When Dustox flap their wings, they let loose clouds of fine, toxic powder strong enough to make pro wrestlers sick. They uses this in their defense, flapping and letting loose the dust to deter enemies. Dustox are attracted to bright lights, a problem for many urban areas; they will often congregate along boulevards and avenues, attracted there by street lamps and large trees. In their wake,&nbsp;Dustox swarms leave behind lines of barren branches and large clouds of toxic powder. Though they will consume nearly any variety of leaves (even some toxic ones, which may have to do with their Poison-typings), Dustox have shown a particular affinity for the leaves of Persim trees, even sometimes feeding on the Berries themselves. This makes them a huge problem for Persim Berry farmers, who consider Dustox the primary pests of the business."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"zq3sb55GQORRG1Of"}
{"name":"tirtouga","permission":{"default":0,"ADtNtonEM4LarFaX":3},"type":"dexentry","data":{"name":"","id":"564","entry":"Once-extinct Tirtouga can now be revived with modern technology from&nbsp; Cover Fossils. These Pokémon were alive about 100,000,000 years ago, meaning that they lived in concurrently with many other known fossil Pokémon like Lileep, Anorith, Cranidos, and Shieldon. Why fossils are found so frequently from this time period is unknown, but scientists hypothesize that some sort of massive storm or other disaster may have caused a mass extinction at the end of this era, wiping out many species and disturbing large amounts of sediment that quickly buried and fossilized their remains.&nbsp;Tirtouga can withstand intense pressure and can dive half a mile (0.8 kilometers) beneath the water’s surface. Though slow and clumsy on land, they nevertheless could beach themselves onto shores in order to capture unsuspecting prey. Indeed, some studies suggest that a sizable portion of their meals came from terrestrial prey. Tirtouga are thought to have gone extinct because they was unable to compete with similar chelonians; although their competitors were slower, they also required less food to survive and reproduce."},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"zskGVWQJ7ih85MQp"}
